# Car-Black-Box
➤ Black boxes are used in transportation systems (e.g., airplanes) for post-crash analysis and identifying the root cause of accidents.
➤ Implemented core functionalities of a car black box using a PIC-based microcontroller with rich peripheral support, enabling continuous monitoring and event logging (e.g., overspeeding).
➤ Logged events in EEPROM, making the system scalable and extendable to various vehicles.
